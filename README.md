# Automation-Perl-Compare-Script

Simple, quick script that let me change the attributes of what I was searching for in an XML file. It simply looked for a parent id and then searched for the child id and all of the children's attributes with that property. I didn't have the tools that would do this type of comparison automatically, so I created this script to help me do this quickly. It worked a whole lot better than doing everything manually, and it saved a lot of time.
